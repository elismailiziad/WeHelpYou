   -  This project's objective is to design a database for a hardware shop, using NetBeans IDE and TomCat application. 
   
   -  The  description of the whole project and study is saved as a pdf file (project_description.pdf).

   -  You will find an explanatory YouTube video link to visualize a demonstration of the database implementation and its different implemented functions, or you can find the code and the database's tables, with the code to create and populate them as well. 

   -  The creation and population files are written in PL/pgSQL and SQL language. With the help of tools such as PostgresSQL JDBC driver and TomCat server, the database is created and linked to Netbeans IDE.
